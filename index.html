        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hi! I'm Tristan Maksad, born and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, and now a Computer Engineering Major at the University of Florida. This major has allowed me to express my biggest passions by using problem solving and analytical thinking to apply my knowledge of software development to other work, hobbies, and more.</p>
        <p>I've applied programming to many elements of my life, from social aspects where I've helped developed numerous group-based projects both in and out of school, to musical aspects where I've researched how machine learning can be implemented into digital audio workstations. I've practically never had a hobby I wouldn't want to expand upon through programming. Every software I've used, every language I've learned, and every function I've written has escaped the binds of the programming courses they originated from, and have each become something much larger.</p>
        <p>As a sophomore in college, I aspire to join internships that enable me to demonstrate these abilities in programming and web development, as well as build on them and spark new talents. I don't want an internship simply for the sake of displaying it on my resume; rather, I want to walk away from it knowing how much I accomplished during my time there, how much I was able to learn and grow as a computer engineer, and how much more ready I feel to pursue a future occupation.</p>
