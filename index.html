        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hi! I'm Tristan Maksad, born and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, and now a Computer Engineering Major at the University of Florida. This major has allowed me to express my biggest passions by using problem solving and analytical thinking to apply my knowledge of software development to other work, hobbies, and more.</p>
        <p>I've applied programming to many elements of my life, from social aspects where I've helped developed numerous group-based projects both in and out of school, to musical aspects where I've researched how machine learning can be implemented into digital audio workstations. I've practically never had a hobby I wouldn't want to expand upon through programming. Every software I've used, every language I've learned, and every function I've written has escaped the binds of the programming courses they originated from, and have each become something much larger.</p>
        <p>As a sophomore in college, I aspire to join internships that enable me to demonstrate these abilities in programming and web development, as well as build on them and spark new talents. I don't want an internship simply for the sake of displaying it on my resume; rather, I want to walk away from it knowing how much I accomplished during my time there, how much I was able to learn and grow as a computer engineer, and how much more ready I feel to pursue a future occupation.</p>

            <h3>Personal  Website</h3>
            <p>
                This is the website you're currently on! This dynamic web portfolio was developed using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to showcase my technical experiences. It was deployed via GitHub Pages with streamlined continuous integration and version control. Future design changes to the website and other projects are planned to be added.

            <h3>Minesweeper</h3>
            <p>
                This is a classic game of minesweeper. It includes standard minesweeper functionalities, as well as a username entry, flag counter, reset button, debug button, pause button, in-game timer, and more. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed a Minesweeper game using C++ with dynamic board sizes and randomized mine generation</li>
                    <li>Utilized SFML to build a leaderboard, responsive interface, and handle user interactions</li>
                    <li>Implemented a Depth-First Search algorithm to reveal mines, improving gameplay performance</li>

            <h3>2D Video Game</h3>
            <p>
                This project, currently titled "Hwan," is a top-down pixel art game being developed by me along with other college students. We have taken some hiatuses while developing it, but we plan to add screen transitions, area randomization, and enemy behavior in the near future.
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing and implementing core gameplay mechanics, including player movement, collision detection, and camera tracking, using the Unity game engine</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with an ever-expanding team through Unity DevOps to support version control, manage team contributions, and allow collaborative development</li>
                    <li>
                        There is no efficient way to link the Unity DevOps repository for viewing purposes. In light of this, a video to the first developer update of the game can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UPuIxaDN2I" target="_blank">here</a>. Everything shown in the video (sprites, code, animations, etc.) was created by me.
