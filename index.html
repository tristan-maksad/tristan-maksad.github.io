        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hi! I'm Tristan Maksad, born and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, and now a Computer Engineering Major at the University of Florida. This major has allowed me to express my biggest passions by using problem-solving and analytical thinking to apply my knowledge of software development to other work, hobbies, and more.</p>
        <p>I have applied programming to many elements of my life, from social aspects by helping develop numerous group-based projects both in and out of school, to musical facets by researching how to implement machine learning into digital audio workstations. Nearly every hobby I pursue, I wish to expand upon through programming. Every software I've used, every language I've learned, and every function I've written has gone beyond the bounds of the programming courses they originated in, becoming something much larger.</p>
        <p>As a college sophomore, I am seeking internships where I can demonstrate and build on my programming and software engineering skills. I want to walk away from an internship knowing how much I accomplished, learned, and grew as a computer engineer, preparing me for my future career.</p>

            <h3>2D Video Game (In Progress)</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed and implemented core gameplay mechanics, including player movement, collision detection, and camera tracking, using the Unity game engine</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with an ever-expanding team through Unity DevOps to support version control, manage team contributions, and allow collaborative development</li>
                    <li>Beginning to implement screen transitions, area randomization, and enemy behavior</li>
                </ul>
                There is no efficient way to link the Unity DevOps repository for viewing purposes. In light of this, a video to the first developer update of the game can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UPuIxaDN2I" target="_blank">here</a>. All code, sprites, and animations in this preview were solely designed by me.
